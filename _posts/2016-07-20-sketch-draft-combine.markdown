**INT. MEETING ROOM**

> Three athletic, middle-aged, executive types (ALAN, BARRY, CLARK) sitting on one side of a table. They're looking over papers in front of them, pointing at the content, nodding, gently disagreeing.

### ALAN

*(looking over papers)*

...Alright, boys. Who's next?

### BARRY
Drayton Ellersby. Boy, this kid's going to be a special player in the NHL.

### CLARK
I don't know, fellas. I'm still not convinced he has the drive-train to take it to the next level.

### ALAN

Well, that's what these interviews are for, Clarky. To get to know what the kid's really like.

*(to an intercom on the desk)*

Tell the Ellersby kid and his agent we're ready for him.

> Enter DRAYTON ELLERSBY, an athletic and innocent-looking 17-year-old prospect, along with his AGENT, tanned, good hair, business casual (suit jacket, jeans).

### AGENT

Drayton, I'd like you to meet Alan McArthur, General Manager of the Idaho Hockey-Potatoes. These are his assistants, Barry Inglethorpe and Clarky Thomas.

### ALL

*(Perfunctory greetings and handshakes)*

### ALAN

Please, take a seat, son.

> DRAYTON sits

### ALAN

So, Drayton: you're coming off a pretty remarkable season.

### DRAYTON

*(modest)*

Well, sir, I had a great coach who pushed me to be my best, and of course great teammates who helped me elevate my play.

### BARRY

Tell me, do you think you have any flaws in your game?

### AGENT

Sorry to cut in here, boys. Drayton, do you need a water?

### DRAYTON

Yes, sir, a water would be swell.

> Exit AGENT

### DRAYTON

Well, Mr. Inglethorpe, sir, my first couple strides could use some work and...

### CLARK

*(sarcastic; mocking)*

My first couple strides could use some work.

### BARRY

Yeah, shut up, kid. You're a snooze.

### ALAN

A grade-A bore.

> ALAN takes out his phone and starts fiddling with it, looking distracted, uninterested

### DRAYTON

*(pause)*

I'm sorry, sirs, did I do something wrong here?

### BARRY

Yes. Obviously. So, make it right: rank your favourite colours in the order they were discovered.

### DRAYTON

Discovered, sir?

### CLARK

*(mildly exasperated)*

What don't you understand? "Number one: green, discovered: 1645 by a Portuguese fishing vessel. Number two: eggshell white, discovered: 1744 by a very clever chicken." We don't have all day.

### DRAYTON

*(doing his best to answer)*

Well, sir, I grew up on a farm with a clear, blue sky up above, so I reckon I'm partial to blue.

### BARRY

*(searching his recollection)*

Blue, blue, blue. Can't say I've heard of it.

### CLARK

Well, son, looks like you've gone and discovered yourself a colour. Well done!

### ALAN

*(still looking at his phone; barely paying attention)*

Unless he's lying...

### CLARK

Yeah, unless you're lying.

### BARRY

You're a little liar, aren't you, Ellersby?

### CLARK

Undress for us, liar.

### BARRY

Yeah, undress for us, liar. You got a kielbasa down there or what?

> DRAYTON looks alarmed, confused. Enter AGENT, holding water bottle.

### AGENT

Here's your water, kid. How's it going?

### DRAYTON

*(confused)*

Uh, fine, sir, I think...

### AGENT

*(reassuring)*

You know how these things go. Lots of weird questions to just try and rattle you.

### BARRY

Drayton was just telling us how he needs to work on his explosiveness with his first couple strides.

### DRAYTON

*(collecting himself)*

...Right, so, I've been training and doing plyometrics to try and lock that in. I want to be an impact player in this league.

### AGENT

*(cell ringing)*

Sorry, boys, I've got to take this.

> AGENT exits. CLARK gets up and locks the door behind him and turns to DRAYTON.

### CLARK

*(accusatory)*

Alan Vega of post-punk legends Suicide died this weekend: what do you know about it?

### DRAYTON

Well, sir, I don't understand the question, but I believe in the importance of mental health and...

### BARRY

No, you idiot. New York, 1977: pulsating keyboards, haunting vocals. Ringing any bells? Ghost Rider? Dream Baby Dream?

### ALAN

*(still looking at phone)*

Cheree?

### BARRY

Cheree? Thank you, Alan. Does this mean nothing to you?

### ALAN

He's lying.

### CLARK

You killed Alan Vega because you were jealous of him, didn't you, Drayton? You wanted to be the darling of the late-70s Bowery and were going to get rid of anyone who stood in your way! Don't try to deny it!

### DRAYTON

*(despearate)*

Look, sir, I'm just a simple hockey player trying to live my dream and play in the NHL.

### ALAN

*(aggressively psyched)*

I caught the Pokémon. Now I am the King of the Pokémon.

### BARRY

Bow before your king, Drayton.

### DRAYTON

Congratulations on your accomplishment, sir.

### ALAN

*(putting phone away; re-invested in conversation)*

Well, Drayton, it's been great chatting with you.

> ALAN gets up and escorts DRAYTON to the door, and unlocks it while saying,

### ALAN

Well, of course, we'd love to take you first overall, but now Barry, Clark and myself are going to kill and eat each other for sport. Good day!

> ALAN closes door behind DRAYTON. BARRY and CLARK have been prepping themselves with bibs, knives, spears. ALAN turns around.

### ALAN

*(to himself)*

Good kid, good kid. Shame I have to get eaten now.
